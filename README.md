## 🧠 About Me

I'm a results-driven **AI/ML engineer** with a passion for combining **machine learning**, **real-time sensor data**, and **geospatial/CAD systems** into practical, deployable solutions. My strengths lie in bridging the gap between **embedded systems** and **AI pipelines**, building everything from PDF/CAD parsing tools to real-time ML for IoT devices.

I've worked remotely with global teams across the **US, Germany, and Ukraine**, and I thrive in environments where systems, sensors, and software meet. I'm equally comfortable writing low-level C++ or Qt, building AutoCAD plugins in C#, or deploying deep learning models with PyTorch.
